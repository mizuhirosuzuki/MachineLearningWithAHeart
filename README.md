# Practice for "Machine Learning With A Heart"
This is a repository to work on a Drivendata project, "Warm Up: Machine Learning with a Heart" (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/page/107/).

- Comparisons of different standardizations ([link](Codes/Practice_standardize.ipynb))
- Comparisons of different preprocessings ([link](Codes/Practice_preprocessing.ipynb))
- Comparisons of different methods for predictions ([link](Codes/Practice_different_methods.ipynb))
  - Logistic regressions with different penalties (lasso, ridge, elastic net)
  - Nearest neighbor methods
  - Tree based models (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost)
  - Deep neural network model
